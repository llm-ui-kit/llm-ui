At the core of llm-ui is `useLLMOutput`. This hook takes a single chat response from an LLM and breaks it into **blocks**.

# Blocks

`useLLMOutput` takes `blocks` and `fallbackBlock` as parameters.

- `blocks` is an array of block configurations that `useLLMOutput` attempts to match against the LLM output.
- `fallbackBlock` is used for parts of the chat response when no other block matches.

## Example

Language model markdown output:

<CodeBlock code={introExampleAllDisplay} lang="markdown" />

If we pass the following parameters to `useLLMOutput`:

- `blocks: [codeBlock]` which matches code blocks starting with <code>```</code>.
- `fallbackBlock: markdownBlock` which assumes anything else is markdown .

`useLLMOutput` will break the chat response into code and markdown blocks.

llm-ui breaks the example into **blocks**:

<Image width="600" src={blocks} alt="Blocks in llm-ui" />

# Throtting

`useLLMOutput` also takes `throttle` as an argument. This function allows `useLLMOutput` to lag behind the actual LLM output.

Here is an example of llm-ui's throttling in action:

<ExampleSideBySide
  client:load
  example={"# H1\nHi Docs\n\n```typescript\nconsole.log('hello')\n```"}
  throttle="buffer"
  options={{ delayMultiplier: 2.5 }}
/>

The disadvantage of throttling is that the llm output is delayed in reaching the user.

The benefits of throttling:

- llm-ui can smooth out pauses in the LLM's streamed output.
- Blocks can hide 'non-user' characters from user (e.g. `##` in a markdown header).
