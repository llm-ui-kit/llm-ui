llm-ui is a React library for displaying large language model (LLM) outputs.

The library operates on the string returned from an LLM. For example:

<CodeBlock>
````
## Python
```python
def hello_llm_ui():
  print("Hello llm-ui!")
```
## Typescript
```typescript
const helloLlmUi = () => {
  console.log("Hello llm-ui!");
};
```
````
</CodeBlock>

llm-ui breaks this example into **blocks**:

<Image width="600" src={blocks} alt="Blocks in llm-ui" />
