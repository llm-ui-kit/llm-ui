llm-ui is a React library for displaying large language model (LLM) outputs.

The library operates on the string returned from an LLM. For example:

<CodeBlock code={introExampleAllDisplay} lang="markdown" />

llm-ui breaks this example into **blocks**:

<Image width="600" src={blocks} alt="Blocks in llm-ui" />

You can then render the **blocks** with your own components.
