llm-ui is a React library for displaying large language model (LLM) outputs.

The library operates on the string returned from an LLM. For example:

````
## Python
```python
def hello_llm_ui():
  print("Hello llm-ui!")
```
## Typescript
```typescript
const helloLlmUi = () => {
  console.log("Hello llm-ui!");
};
```
````

llm-ui breaks this example into **blocks**:

<Image width="600" src={blocks} alt="Blocks in llm-ui" />

## Features

- [markdown](/docs/blocks/markdown) blocks
- [code](/docs/blocks/code) blocks
- Build your own custom blocks
- [Throtting](/docs/throttling) smooths out pauses in the LLM's streamed output
- Blocks can hide 'non-user' characters from user (e.g. `##` in a markdown header)
- Renders the correct number of characters per frame for a smooth user experience
- Headless: Unopinionated about styling -> bring your own styles
