Custom blocks allow LLMs to reply with specific formats which can be rendered as custom components in your application.

# Formats

## Json

<CodeBlockInline>

```plain
【{ type:"buttons", buttons: [{text:"Button 1"}, {text:"Button 2"}] }】
```

</CodeBlockInline>

- ✅ Good for advanced use cases
- ⚠️ High overhead of non-content characters

## Seperated values

<CodeBlockInline>

```plain
±Button 1;Button 2§
```

</CodeBlockInline>

- ✅ Good for simple responses
- ✅ Low overhead of non-content characters (only: ±,§ and ;)
