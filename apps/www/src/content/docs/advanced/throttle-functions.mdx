import { siteConfig } from "@/config/site";

Throttle functions control how quickly the LLM's output is displayed.

Throttle functions can:

- Smooth out pauses in the LLM's streamed output
- Allows blocks to parse the LLM output before the user sees it.
  - This allows blocks to hide 'non-user' characters from the user (e.g. `##` in a markdown header)

# Usage with `useLLMOutput`

Throttle functions are passed to the `useLLMOutput` hook.

```ts
const { blockMatches } = useLLMOutput({
  llmOutput: output,
  blocks: [],
  fallbackBlock,
  isStreamFinished,
  throttle: ..., // <- throttle function
});
```

# Built in throttle functions

llm-ui comes with a built-in throttle function:

## `throttleBasic`

`throttleBasic` is the default throttle function for llm-ui.

```ts
import { throttleBasic } from "llm-ui/throttle";

const throttle = throttleBasic({
  readAheadChars: 10,
  lagBufferMs: 200,
  frameLookbackMs: 200,
  behindIncrementFactor: 3,
  aheadIncrementFactor: 1 / 3,
});

const { blockMatches } = useLLMOutput({
  llmOutput: output,
  blocks: [],
  fallbackBlock,
  isStreamFinished,
  throttle, // <- used here
});
```

`throttleBasic` has the following options:

### `readAheadChars` (number)

Default: `10`

The number of visible characters to withhold from the user whilst `isStreamFinished` is `false`.

### `lagBufferMs` (number)

Default: `200`

The target number of milliseconds behind the actual LLM output `useLLMOutput` should be.

`readAheadChars` is already taken into account when calculating this value.

This value is transformed into a target number of visible characters to withhold from the user based on the `frameLookbackMs`...

### `frameLookbackMs` (number)

default: `200`

The number of milliseconds to look back when making estimations about how fast the visible text is being produced.

### `behindIncrementFactor` (number)

Default: `3`

When the throttle is behind the target number of visible characters, the throttle will increase the number of visible characters displayed by this factor to catch back up to the target.

### `aheadIncrementFactor` (number)

Default: `1/3`

Similar to `behindIncrementFactor`, when the throttle is ahead of the target number of visible characters, the throttle will decrease the number of visible characters displayed by this factor to slow down.

# Writing your own throttle function

Writing your own throttle function is an advanced endeavour. If you're thinking of writing one or `throttleBasic` doesn't meet your needs please feel free to hop into our discord to chat.
